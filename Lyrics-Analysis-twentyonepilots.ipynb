    "How do we get from copy and pasted lyrics only, to a broad dataset with custom information for each line of song lyric?\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the process:\n",
    "1. Copy and paste the lyrics from your chosen song into a new csv file. I've called this \"one_song_lyrics_only.csv\".\n",
    "2. Skim the lyrics in the csv file and look for any lines with commas. Commas are the default delimiter, so they will be interpreted not as part of the lyric but as an indicator of a new cell of content. If you use an IDE like Visual Studio Code, extensions like Rainbow CSV can help these jump out immediately. It's your choice how to manage these lines so the dataframe can be properly read and compiled. Here are some options:\n",
    "   > - My usual preference: simply count every comma in a song's lyrics as a new lyric line, and manually delete it and add a new line. (Just backspace and return after each comma when you see one.) It takes a bit extra time and effort, but I prefer to interpret many song lyrics like this manually.\n",
    "   > - Wrap the lines with commas in double-quotes. Note that this will force your whole line as a string object, but this should be the default for the rest of your lines anyway. I use this as well. The decision between this option and the last is an artistic one, regarding what you qualify as a singular lyric. Consider rhyming scheme when trying to decide what should remain one line or can be separated.\n",
    "   > - If you want to avoid the issue altogether upfront and leave commas inside the lyric as part of a single lyric line without bothering with double-quotes, you can adjust the dataframe parameter for field delimiters and use something else like a semicolon. E.g., pandas.dataframe_name.read_csv(sep=';'). I haven't implemented this personally so the approach may need some adjusting. Just be aware it can get dicey if you're trying to combine dataframes that are using different delimiters, and the default is a comma.\n",
    "3. Starting with a file with just one column containing a song's lyrics, build a dataframe with more columns that include details about the song, to match our comprehensive lyrics dataframe. Step through the cells below for the functions to do this.\n",
    "4. Concatenate/append this one song's dataframe to our comprehensive lyrics dataframe.\n",
    "5. Check our files and variables and then write the new and improved, extended comprehensive dataframe to our main lyrics data csv file. (Again, be careful when writing over big files. You can write to a temporary file to check accuracy beforehand; I used one called \"testingoutput.csv\".)\n",
    "\n",
    "*If you want to inspect the lyrics I have built with this method, you can find them in the file tree. To find these through Jupyter, click on the Jupyter logo in the upper left corner. You can, of course, also view these in the file directory in the github repository.*"
