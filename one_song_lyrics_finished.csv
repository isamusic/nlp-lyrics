Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,I wake up fine and dandy,1
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,but then by the time I find it handy,2
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,To rip my heart apart and start planning my crash landing,3
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,"I go up, up, up, up, up to the ceiling",4
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,Then I feel my soul start leaving ,5
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,like an old man's hair receding,6
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,I'm pleading,7
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,"Please, oh please",8
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,on my knees repeatedly asking,9
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,Why it's got to be like this,10
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,is this living free?,11
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,I don't wanna be the one be the one ,12
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,to have the Sun's blood on my hands,13
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,I'll tell the moon,14
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,Take this weapon,15
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,forged in darkness,16
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,Some see a pen,17
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,I see a harpoon,18
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,I'll stay awake ,19
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,'cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight,20
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,Why am I not scared in the morning?,21
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,I don't hear those voices calling,22
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,I must have kicked them out,23
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,I must have kicked them out,24
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,I swear I heard demons yelling,25
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,Those crazy words they were spelling,26
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,They told me I was gone,27
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,they told me I was gone,28
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,But I'll tell 'em,29
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,Why won't you let me go?,30
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,Do I threaten all your plans? I'm insignificant,31
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,Please tell 'em,32
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,you have no plans for me,33
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,I will set my soul on fire,34
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,what have I become?,35
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,I'll tell 'em,36
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,On the eve of a day that's forgotten and fake,37
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,As the trees,38
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,they await,39
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,and clouds anticipate,40
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,The start of a day when we put on our face,41
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,A mask that portrays that we don't need grace,42
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,On the eve of a day that is bigger than us,43
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,But we open our eyes 'cause we're told that we must,44
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,And the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead,45
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,Desperately yelling,46
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,There's something we need,47
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,I'm not free,48
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,I asked forgiveness three times,49
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,Same amount that I denied,50
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,I three-time MVP'd this crime,51
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,I'm afraid to tell you who I adore,52
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,won't tell you who I'm singing towards,53
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,Metaphorically,54
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,I'm a whore,55
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,and that's denial number four,56
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,I'll stay awake 'cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight,57
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,"Oh, oh-oh",58
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,Why am I not scared in the morning?,59
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,I don't hear those voices calling,60
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,I must have kicked them out,61
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,I must have kicked them out,62
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,I swear I heard demons yelling,63
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,Those crazy words they were spelling,64
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,They told me I was gone,65
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,they told me I was gone,66
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,But I'll tell 'em,67
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,Why won't you let me go?,68
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,Do I threaten all your plans? I'm insignificant,69
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,Please tell 'em,70
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,you have no plans for me,71
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,I will set my soul on fire,72
Vessel,Ode to Sleep,1,what have I become?,73
