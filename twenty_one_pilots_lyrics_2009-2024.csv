Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,I wanna fall inside your ghost,1
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,And fill up every hole inside my mind,2
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,And I want everyone to know,3
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,That I am half a soul divided,4
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,Sometimes we will die and sometimes we will fly away,5
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,Either way you're by my side until my dying days,6
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,And if I'm not there and I'm far away,7
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,"I said, don't be afraid",8
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,"I said, don't be afraid",9
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,We're going home,10
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,I wanna strip myself of breath,11
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,A breathless beast of death I've made for you,12
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,A mortal writing piece of song,13
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,Will help me carry on,14
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,But these you heard,15
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,Sometimes we will die and sometimes we will fly away,16
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,Either way you're by my side until my dying days,17

Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,"I said, don't be afraid",19
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,"I said, don't be afraid",20
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,We're going home,21
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,So the hearse ran out of gas,22
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,A passenger purse and grabbed a map,23
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,And the driver inside it contrived a new route to save the past,24
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,And checked his watch and grabbed a cab,25
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,A beautifully planned taxi cab,26
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,A cab,27
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,had it cleared out back,28
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,And two men started to unpack,29
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,Driving once again,30
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,But now this time there were three men,31
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,And then I heard one of them say,32
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,I know the night will turn to gray,33
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,I know the stars will start to fade,34
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,When all the darkness fades away,35
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,We had to steal him from his fate,36
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,So he could see another day,37
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,Then I cracked open my box,38
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,Someone must have picked the lock,39
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,A little light revealed the spot,40
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,Where my fingernails had fought,41
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,Then I pushed it open more,42
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,Pushing up against the door,43
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,Then I sat up off the floor,44
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,And found the breath I was searching for,45
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,Then there were three men up front,46
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,All I saw were backs of heads,47
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,And then I asked them am I alive and well or am I dreaming dead,48
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,And then one turned around to say,49
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,We're driving toward the morning sun,50
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,Where all your blood is washed away,51
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,And all you did will be undone,52
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,"I said, don't be afraid",53
Johnny Boy - EP,Taxi Cab,6,"I said, don't be afraid",54

Twenty One Pilots,March to the Sea,6,And we're dying with every step we take,2
Twenty One Pilots,March to the Sea,6,We're dying with every breath we make,3

Twenty One Pilots,March to the Sea,6,A stranger's back is all I see,5
Twenty One Pilots,March to the Sea,6,He's only a few feet in front of me,6

Twenty One Pilots,March to the Sea,6,Then we fall asleep,17
Twenty One Pilots,March to the Sea,6,As we near the end of land,18
Twenty One Pilots,March to the Sea,6,And our ocean graves are just beyond the sand,19
Twenty One Pilots,March to the Sea,6,I ask myself the question,20
Twenty One Pilots,March to the Sea,6,why,21
Twenty One Pilots,March to the Sea,6,I fall in line,22
Twenty One Pilots,March to the Sea,6,Then out of the corner of my eye,23

Twenty One Pilots,March to the Sea,6,And hear a voice inside my head,25
Twenty One Pilots,March to the Sea,6,Follow me instead,26
Twenty One Pilots,March to the Sea,6,Follow me instead,27

Twenty One Pilots,March to the Sea,6,And the emotionless marchers will chant the phrase,31
Twenty One Pilots,March to the Sea,6,This line's the only way,32
Twenty One Pilots,March to the Sea,6,Then I start down the sand,33
Twenty One Pilots,March to the Sea,6,My eyes are focused on the end of land,34
Twenty One Pilots,March to the Sea,6,But again the voice inside my head,35
Twenty One Pilots,March to the Sea,6,"Says, follow me instead",36
Twenty One Pilots,March to the Sea,6,Follow me instead,37

Twenty One Pilots,March to the Sea,6,I don't want to march here anymore,46
Twenty One Pilots,March to the Sea,6,I realize that this line is dead,47
Twenty One Pilots,March to the Sea,6,So I'll follow you instead,48
Twenty One Pilots,March to the Sea,6,So then you put me back in my place,49
Twenty One Pilots,March to the Sea,6,So I might start another day,50
Twenty One Pilots,March to the Sea,6,And once again,51
Twenty One Pilots,March to the Sea,6,I will be,52
Twenty One Pilots,March to the Sea,6,In a march to the sea,53

Twenty One Pilots,"A Car, a Torch, a Death",11,I began to understand why God died,11
Twenty One Pilots,"A Car, a Torch, a Death",11,The demons sat there waiting on her porch,12
Twenty One Pilots,"A Car, a Torch, a Death",11,It was a little dark so we held a makeshift torch,13
Twenty One Pilots,"A Car, a Torch, a Death",11,And when my car was far out of sight,14
Twenty One Pilots,"A Car, a Torch, a Death",11,He crept in her room and stayed there for the night,15
Twenty One Pilots,"A Car, a Torch, a Death",11,And then I felt chills in my bones,16
Twenty One Pilots,"A Car, a Torch, a Death",11,The breath I saw was not my own,17
Twenty One Pilots,"A Car, a Torch, a Death",11,I knew my skin that wrapped my frame,18
Twenty One Pilots,"A Car, a Torch, a Death",11,Wasn't made to play this game,19
Twenty One Pilots,"A Car, a Torch, a Death",11,And then I saw him,20
Twenty One Pilots,"A Car, a Torch, a Death",11,torch in hand,21
Twenty One Pilots,"A Car, a Torch, a Death",11,He laid it out,22
Twenty One Pilots,"A Car, a Torch, a Death",11,what he had planned,23
Twenty One Pilots,"A Car, a Torch, a Death",11,And then I said I'll take the grave,24
Twenty One Pilots,"A Car, a Torch, a Death",11,Please just send them all my way,25
Twenty One Pilots,"A Car, a Torch, a Death",11,And then I felt chills in my bones,26
Twenty One Pilots,"A Car, a Torch, a Death",11,The breath I saw was not my own,27
Twenty One Pilots,"A Car, a Torch, a Death",11,I knew my skin that wrapped my frame,28
Twenty One Pilots,"A Car, a Torch, a Death",11,Wasn't made to play this game,29
Twenty One Pilots,"A Car, a Torch, a Death",11,And then I saw him,30
Twenty One Pilots,"A Car, a Torch, a Death",11,torch in hand,31
Twenty One Pilots,"A Car, a Torch, a Death",11,He laid it out,32
Twenty One Pilots,"A Car, a Torch, a Death",11,what he had planned,33
Twenty One Pilots,"A Car, a Torch, a Death",11,And then I said I'll take the grave,34
Twenty One Pilots,"A Car, a Torch, a Death",11,Please just send them all my way,35
Twenty One Pilots,"A Car, a Torch, a Death",11,I began to understand why God died,36
Twenty One Pilots,"A Car, a Torch, a Death",11,The air begins to feel a little thin,37
Twenty One Pilots,"A Car, a Torch, a Death",11,As we're waiting for the morning to begin,38
Twenty One Pilots,"A Car, a Torch, a Death",11,But for now you told me to hold this jar,39
Twenty One Pilots,"A Car, a Torch, a Death",11,And when I looked inside I saw it held your heart,40
Twenty One Pilots,"A Car, a Torch, a Death",11,For me to walk away with,41
Twenty One Pilots,"A Car, a Torch, a Death",11,I began to understand why God died,42
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,I wanna fall inside your ghost,1
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,And fill up every hole inside my mind,2
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,And I want everyone to know,3
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,That I am half a soul divided,4
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,Sometimes we will die and sometimes we will fly away,5
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,Either way you're by my side until my dying days,6
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,And if I'm not there and I'm far away,7
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,"I said, don't be afraid",8
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,"I said, don't be afraid",9
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,We're going home,10
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,I wanna strip myself of breath,11
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,A breathless beast of death I've made for you,12
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,A mortal writing piece of song,13
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,Will help me carry on,14
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,But these you heard,15
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,Sometimes we will die and sometimes we will fly away,16
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,Either way you're by my side until my dying days,17
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,And if I'm not there and I'm far away,18
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,"I said, don't be afraid",19
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,"I said, don't be afraid",20
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,We're going home,21
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,So the hearse ran out of gas,22
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,A passenger purse and grabbed a map,23
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,And the driver inside it contrived a new route to save the past,24
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,And checked his watch and grabbed a cab,25
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,A beautifully planned taxi cab,26
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,A cab,27
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,had it cleared out back,28
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,And two men started to unpack,29
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,Driving once again,30
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,But now this time there were three men,31
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,And then I heard one of them say,32
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,I know the night will turn to gray,33
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,I know the stars will start to fade,34
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,When all the darkness fades away,35
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,We had to steal him from his fate,36
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,So he could see another day,37
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,Then I cracked open my box,38
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,Someone must have picked the lock,39
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,A little light revealed the spot,40
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,Where my fingernails had fought,41
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,Then I pushed it open more,42
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,Pushing up against the door,43
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,Then I sat up off the floor,44
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,And found the breath I was searching for,45
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,Then there were three men up front,46
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,All I saw were backs of heads,47
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,And then I asked them am I alive and well or am I dreaming dead,48
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,And then one turned around to say,49
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,We're driving toward the morning sun,50
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,Where all your blood is washed away,51
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,And all you did will be undone,52
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,"I said, don't be afraid",53
Twenty One Pilots,Taxi Cab,12,"I said, don't be afraid",54

Twenty One Pilots,Isle of Flightless Birds,14,We pick songs to sing,17
Twenty One Pilots,Isle of Flightless Birds,14,remind us of things that nobody cares about,18
Twenty One Pilots,Isle of Flightless Birds,14,And honestly we're probably more suicidal than ever now,19
Twenty One Pilots,Isle of Flightless Birds,14,If you decide to live by,20
