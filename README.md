Currently this project involves building and analyzing a dataframe of one musician's comprehensive discography. \n
Twenty one pilots is the selected example. \n

Dataframe building is complete! \n
Albums:
* 'Johnny Boy - EP'
* 'Twenty One Pilots'
* 'Regional at Best'
* 'Vessel'
* 'Blurryface'
* 'Trench'
* 'Scaled and Icy'
* 'Clancy'
Singles:
* 'Christmas Saves the Year'
* 'Level of Concern'
* 'Heathens' \n

I purposefully haven't included live ver., livestream ver., or covers of other artists' songs.
