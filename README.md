This will help us decide what directions to take our research in!

Currently this project involves building and analyzing a dataframe of one musician's comprehensive discography. \
Twenty one pilots is the selected example. 

Dataframe building is complete! 

Albums:
* 'Johnny Boy - EP'
* 'Twenty One Pilots'
* 'Regional at Best'
* 'Vessel'
* 'Blurryface'
* 'Trench'
* 'Scaled and Icy'
* 'Clancy'

Singles:
* 'Christmas Saves the Year'
* 'Level of Concern'
* 'Heathens'

I purposefully haven't included live ver., livestream ver., or covers of other artists' songs.

### How to Run This Project Yourself
* Install the required tools, starting with jupyterlab:
  * [Install Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/install)
  * Once jupyter lab is installed, run 'jupyter lab' in terminal inside the repo folder.
  * Once the JupyterLab tab has opened in your default browser, navigate to the "Lyrics-Analysis-twentyonepilots.ipynb" file and open it.
  * Follow the further install directions inside this file, and you'll be able to run it!
* This project uses [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html) and [NLTK (Natural Language Tool Kit)](https://www.nltk.org/install.html) as NLP tools for coding with Python.
